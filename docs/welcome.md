## Welcome
Welcome to the Kahoot API Documentation by [@theusaf](https://github.com/theusaf).

**This documentation is currently a work in progress**

### What is this?
This documentation lists events, urls, and functions used to interact with [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com)'s services.

Kahoot's API uses mostly [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and relies on [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) for most of its functions. Other functions, such as searching use HTTP `GET` and `POST` requests.

### Prerequisites:
- JavaScript, Node.JS, Python, Etc.
- JSON
- Making HTTP requests
- WebSockets

### Disclaimer:
This documentation is not an official documentation for Kahoot and may be outdated, incorrect or incomplete.

Some examples use [kahoot.js-updated](https://npmjs.com/package/kahoot.js-updated) and other similar projects to help you understand how to quickly create bots without knowing the API.
