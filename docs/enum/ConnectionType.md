## ConnectionType
A type of connection to Kahoot's server.

- `websocket` - A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSocket</a> connection.

- [`long-polling`](https://javascript.info/long-polling) - A method of real-time communication with a server via HTTP requests.

- [`callback-polling`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/919546/what-is-callback-polling) - A method of real-time communication with a server via HTTP requests. Similar to long-polling.

*There may be more connection types, but I haven't encountered them yet. `websocket` is the one best documented and used.*
