A Kahoot! botting website for joining and winning games with a simple, feature-packed UI. Made by [Charley Wright](https://github.com/charleywright/Kahoot-rocks-old). You can search for quizzes and quickly select the quiz you are playing.

- ### [kahoot-bot.herokuapp.com](http://kahoot-bot.herokuapp.com/)
A Kahoot! botting website for joining and answering games. Has a really bad UI, but it works. Does not support team mode.

The following sites do not appear to be working:
- ~kahootsmasher.club~ (Not working, likely blocked by Kahoot!)
- ~omegaboot.com~ (Taken down by Kahoot!)
- ~kahoot-hack.glitch.me~ (Clone of kahoot.ninja's frontend with no backend support or working links...)
  - Why is this even at the top of google's search results???
- ~kahoot.ninja~ (Not working, unmaintained)
- ~mem.rip/kahoot~ (Not working, service down)
- ~kahootflooder.com~ (Not working, unmaintained?)
- ~kahooters.org~ (Not working, webspam. The page never sends anything to a server and claims to recieve requests, wasting users time.)
