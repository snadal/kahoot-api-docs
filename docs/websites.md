The following sites do not appear to be working:
- ~kahootsmasher.club~ (Not working, likely blocked by Kahoot!)
- ~kahoot-hack.glitch.me~ (Clone of kahoot.ninja's frontend with no backend support or working links...)
  - Why is this even at the top of google's search results???
- ~kahoot.ninja~ (Not working, unmaintained)
- ~mem.rip/kahoot~ (Not working, currently blocked by kahoot.)
- ~kahootflooder.com~ (Not working, unmaintained?)
- ~omegaboot.com~ (Not working, taken down by Kahoot!)
